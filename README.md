# RALTS (Really Awesome Lexicon and Tag Suggester)

RALTS stands for Really Awesome Lexicon and Tag Suggester and itâ€™s a script that extracts entities, topics, and categories from a body of text using the TextRazor API. But it also uses natural language classification to analyse that text further, with the extracted topics as labels.

I've written a full-length blog post about the script and why I made it, which you can [read on my personal website](https://lukealexdavis.co.uk/post/introducing-ralts/).
